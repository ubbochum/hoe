# Data Format

You can find a regularly updated export of the data gathered in the project here. At this moment it is a simple dump of
our internal JSON format used for round-tripping between changes in the data model or conversion routines. As such it
is not the most compact representation of the data and it's structure is subject to change (though not much, we hope).
During the course of the project we plan, however, to optimise this representation and to transfer the model into a
linked data application profile which re-ueses as many already established resources as possible...
