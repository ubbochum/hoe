#Historiography of the Ottoman Empire

This is the platform for the joint project by the [University Library Bochum](http://www.ub.rub.de) and
[the chair in History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey](http://www.ort.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/index.html.en) of
[Ruhr-University Bochum](http://www.rub.de) [funded by the DFG](http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/249662419). The
platform enables researchers to register primary and secondary literature and to search it with state of the art search
engine technology. The web application is implemented with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and as the search engine we
employ [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) while the depiction oof cartographic data is based on
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) and the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) library.
